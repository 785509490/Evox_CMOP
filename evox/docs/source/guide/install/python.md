# Python Installation Guide

EvoX is written in Python, so you will need to have Python installed on your system.
EvoX support Python 3.9 and above, and we recommend using the latest version of Python.

## Windows Version

Go to [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.

Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.

## Linux Version

Different Linux distributions have different ways to install Python.
It depends on the package manager of your distribution.
Here are some examples:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt`
